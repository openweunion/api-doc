  Complete Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) information including configuration details.

  This schema extends `VASP` with additional fields like email, webhook URL, and status.
  Used when a VASP retrieves their own detailed information.

  **Difference from `VASP`:**
  - `VASP`: Basic public information (id, name, description, timestamps)
  - `VASPFull`: Complete information including email, webhookUrl, and status (for own VASP only)
