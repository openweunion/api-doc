    **Result:**
    - A new transaction is created with status `NEW`
    - The Originator VASP should then call the Approve endpoint to proceed

    **Required Data:**
    - `originatorVASPId`: Your VASP ID (the caller's VASP ID)
    - `beneficiaryVASPId`: The VASP ID that will process the fiat withdrawal
    - `quoteId`: A valid quote ID obtained from the List Quotes endpoint
    - `withdrawalInfo`: Bank account details for the fiat withdrawal

    **Optional Data:**
    - `travelRuleData`: Required for compliance with travel rule regulations

  operationId: updateTransaction
  summary: Update Transaction Hash
  description: |
    Submit the on-chain transaction hash after completing the blockchain transfer.

    **Preconditions:**
    - Transaction status must be: `PENDING_TRANSFER`
    - Only the Originator VASP can submit the transaction hash
    - The on-chain transaction must have been broadcasted

    **Result:**
    - Transaction status changes to `TRANSFERRED`
    - The Beneficiary VASP will receive a webhook notification
    - The Beneficiary VASP can then verify the on-chain transaction and complete the fiat withdrawal

    **Flow:** This is called after the Originator VASP has executed the actual blockchain transfer following the `POST /transactions/transfer` call.
