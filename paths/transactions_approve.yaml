  summary: Approve Transaction
  description: |
    Approve a transaction by the Originator VASP.

    **Preconditions:**
    - Transaction status must be: `NEW`
    - Only the Originator VASP has permission to approve the transaction

    **Result:**
    - Transaction status changes to `APPROVED`
    - The Beneficiary VASP will receive a webhook notification to accept or reject the transaction

    **Flow:** This is typically called after the Originator VASP has verified the transaction details and is ready to proceed.
