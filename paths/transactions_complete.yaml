  summary: Complete Transaction
  description: |
    Complete a transaction by the Beneficiary VASP after the fiat withdrawal has been processed.

    **Preconditions:**
    - Transaction status must be: `TRANSFERRED`
    - Only the Beneficiary VASP has permission to complete the transaction
    - The on-chain transfer must have been confirmed

    **Result:**
    - Transaction status changes to `COMPLETED`
    - The Originator VASP will receive a webhook notification
    - The `referenceId` from the bank/payment provider is recorded for audit purposes

    **Flow:** This is the final step in the offramp flow. The Beneficiary VASP calls this after successfully processing the fiat withdrawal to the user's bank account.
