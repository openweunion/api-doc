    - Offramp Transaction Endpoints
  operationId: transferTransaction
  summary: Initiate Transfer
  description: |
    Initiate an on-chain transfer for a transaction by the Originator VASP.

    **Preconditions:**
    - Transaction status must be: `ACCEPTED`
    - Only the Originator VASP has permission to initiate the transfer

    **Result:**
    - Transaction status changes to `PENDING_TRANSFER`
    - The Originator VASP should then execute the actual on-chain transfer
    - After the on-chain transfer is complete, call `PUT /transactions` to submit the transaction hash

    **Flow:** This endpoint signals the intent to transfer. The actual blockchain transaction should be executed separately, and the resulting transaction hash should be submitted via the Update Transaction Hash endpoint.
