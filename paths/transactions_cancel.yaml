  summary: Cancel Transaction
  description: |
    Cancel a transaction by the Originator VASP.

    **Preconditions:**
    - Transaction status must be one of: `NEW`, `APPROVED`, or `ACCEPTED`
    - Only the Originator VASP has permission to cancel the transaction

    **Result:**
    - Transaction status changes to `CANCELLED`
    - If a Beneficiary VASP is involved, they will receive a webhook notification

    **Note:** Transactions in `PENDING_TRANSFER`, `TRANSFERRED`, or `COMPLETED` status cannot be cancelled.
