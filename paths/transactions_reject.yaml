  summary: Reject Transaction
  description: |
    Reject a transaction by the Beneficiary VASP.

    **Preconditions:**
    - Transaction status must be: `APPROVED`
    - Only the Beneficiary VASP has permission to reject the transaction

    **Result:**
    - Transaction status changes to `REJECTED`
    - The Originator VASP will receive a webhook notification
    - The transaction cannot proceed further after rejection

    **Flow:** This is called by the Beneficiary VASP when they cannot or choose not to process the transaction request.
